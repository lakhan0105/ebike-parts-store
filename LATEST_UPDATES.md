## Admin Access Added 📱

I have updated the **Header** to include Admin controls that are verified to work on mobile devices:

1.  **Admin Login Action**:
    *   Added an **Admin** link (User icon) in the header.
    *   On mobile, it shows a clean **User Icon** to save space.
    *   Clicking it takes you to the **Admin Login** page.

2.  **After Logging In**:
    *   The icon changes to a **Dashboard Icon** (for accessing the admin panel).
    *   A **Logout Icon** (red color) appears next to it.
    *   This ensures you can easily log out from any page, even on mobile.

3.  **Responsive Layout**:
    *   The navigation adapts to screen size.
    *   "Home" and "Cart" text labels are hidden on very small screens to ensure the Admin buttons fit perfectly.

You can now login and logout easily from the header on any device!
